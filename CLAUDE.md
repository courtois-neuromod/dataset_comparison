# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Overview

This project systematically compares dense neuroAI datasets in terms of the volume and depth of neural data and cognitive states available. It is built on the [`invoke`](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) task runner. The `airoh` pip package provides reusable invoke tasks; this repo customizes them via `tasks.py` and `invoke.yaml`.

**Package manager:** `uv` (see `pyproject.toml`).

**Pipeline:** `fetch` validates all YAML files in `source_data/` against `source_data/schema.json`; `run-tables` runs `analysis/tables.py` to produce `output_data/datasets_tidy_*.csv`; `run-figures` executes notebooks in `notebooks/` (reading the tidy CSVs) to produce figures in `output_data/`. All source data is manually curated and version-controlled via git.

## Dataset Assets

Each dataset has two files in `source_data/`:

- `<name>.yaml` — structured data entry, validated against `source_data/schema.json`. Only populate fields that are relevant to the dataset (e.g. omit `neuroimaging.meg` entirely if the dataset has no MEG).
- `<name>.md` — markdown sidecar that justifies every value in the YAML with direct quotes from the corresponding publication(s) or official documentation.

The markdown sidecar should:
- Cover each field present in the YAML
- Justify every number with a direct quote from the publication or documentation
- Cite the source of each quote (paper title/DOI or URL)
- Flag any values that could not be confirmed or are approximate

When asked to work on a dataset entry:
1. Identify which schema fields are relevant to the dataset
2. Search for the paper(s) and/or documentation to find supporting quotes
3. Draft or update `source_data/<name>.yaml` with only the relevant fields
4. Draft or update `source_data/<name>.md` with quoted evidence for each field
5. Flag any fields where information could not be found or is ambiguous

## Setup

```bash
# uv (recommended):
uv sync

# pip:
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Common Commands

With `uv`:
```bash
uv run invoke fetch           # Validate dataset YAML files against schema
uv run invoke run             # Full pipeline (fetch → run-notebooks)
uv run invoke run-notebooks   # Execute notebooks, save figures to output_data/
uv run invoke clean           # Remove output_data/ contents
uv run invoke --list          # Show all available tasks
```

Without `uv` (activate your environment first):
```bash
invoke fetch              # Validate dataset YAML files against schema
invoke run                # Full pipeline
invoke run-notebooks      # Execute notebooks, save figures to output_data/
invoke clean              # Remove output_data/ contents
invoke --list             # Show all available tasks
```

## Architecture

**Execution flow:** `invoke run` triggers the project's analysis pipeline via `pre=` dependencies declared in `tasks.py`. The three permanent tasks — `fetch`, `run`, `clean` — are always present; intermediate steps are project-specific.

- `invoke.yaml` — all path config (`output_data_dir`, `source_data_dir`, `notebooks_dir`)
- `tasks.py` — project-specific invoke tasks; imports reusable tasks from `airoh.utils`
- `analysis/tables.py` — defines `COLUMN_GROUPS` (field registry with labels, dotpaths, units, colors) and `build_tidy_table(source_dir)` which produces the long-format DataFrame; run via `run-tables`
- `source_data/schema.json` — JSON Schema for dataset YAML files; edit here to add new modalities or fields
- `notebooks/` — Jupyter notebooks executed by `run_notebooks` via `airoh.utils.run_notebooks`; notebooks receive `OUTPUT_DATA_DIR` as an environment variable and read `datasets_tidy.csv` from it
- `source_data/CONTENT.md` and `output_data/CONTENT.md` — authoritative docs for what each data folder contains; update these when data assets change, do not duplicate their content elsewhere

**Analysis vs. notebooks:** Heavy computation belongs in `analysis/` Python code, invoked by `run-{name}` tasks, which write results to `output_data/`. Notebooks are for visualization only — they read from `output_data/` and produce figures. This keeps notebooks fast and focused.

**Idempotent tasks:** Each `run-{name}` task must check whether its outputs already exist and skip execution if they do. This means `invoke run` can be called repeatedly during development of a later step — earlier steps are skipped automatically. To force a full rerun, call `invoke clean` first, then `invoke run`.

**Task naming conventions:**
- Analysis tasks are named `run-{name}` (e.g. `run-tables`, `run-figures`).
- Cleaning tasks mirror them: `clean-{name}` removes only the outputs of the corresponding step.
- The top-level `clean` task calls all `clean-{name}` tasks in sequence.
- The top-level `run` task wires all steps together via `pre=` chains in `tasks.py`.

**Task parameters:** `run-{name}` tasks should expose chunk or subset parameters (e.g. a dataset name) so that individual pieces can be rerun in isolation. They should also support a `smoke` flag for a fast minimal run useful for testing the pipeline end-to-end without running the full analysis.

**Adding a new schema field:** edit `source_data/schema.json`, then update any existing YAML files that should carry the new field.

**Adding a new analysis step:** add a function to `analysis/`, add a `run-{name}` task and a matching `clean-{name}` task in `tasks.py`, wire both into the top-level `run` and `clean` tasks via `pre=` chains, and create or extend a notebook in `notebooks/` for visualization.

**Evolving CLAUDE.md:** As the project grows, update this file to document the specific analysis steps, data sources, and decisions for this project. The airoh conventions above (idempotent tasks, `run-{name}`/`clean-{name}` pairs, analysis-in-code/visualization-in-notebooks) apply for the lifetime of the project.

**README.md** is the user-facing documentation for this project. Any structural or workflow changes — new tasks, renamed folders, updated commands, new dependencies — must be reflected there. For data folder contents, point to `source_data/CONTENT.md` and `output_data/CONTENT.md` rather than duplicating their content inline.
